## Main Concepts

* Level up forever! No limits.
* Time is the enemy. Mistakes should slow progress, not cost progress.
* Optimize gear loadout to maximize level gain.
* Promote periodical sacrifice / resurrect.
* Online ladder play - reset every day / week
* Different classes.  Comparison should be made only between the same class.
* All stats should be useful. Different classes should prefer different stats.

* Killing blow forces hero to use recovery: maximizes health but lowers damage by [50%] for [5s].
* Resurrecting inherits all gear; increases XP by [1%] per level sacrificed.
* Hero stats start at [100] and increase by [5%] every level.
* Wearing decent (green) gear should increase stats by [100%].
* Enemy stats are balanced to green gear level so assume hero stats == enemy stats.

## Classes

Each class has [3] abilities they can leave active: defense, offense, and low level (for killing weenies).

* Warrior
  * defense - increase armor
  * offense - increase power
  * low level - deal damage to 2 targets
* Rogue
  * defensive - increase dodge
  * offense - increase accuracy
  * low level - initiative (first attack)
* Priest
  * defensive - self heal
  * offense - ??
  * low level - free recover after combat

## Weapons

* Weapons vary by speed.  All speeds should have some benefits.
* All 4 weapon styles should be viable: [PoE]
  * Single Weapon - base
  * Two-Hander - +damage, -attack speed (basically super slow single weapon without option of shield)
  * Sword / Shield - +dodge, [-accuracy]
  * 2x Sword - +attack speed, -accuracy

## Stats

Offense  | Defense    | Equation
-------- | ---------- | --------
Power    | Armor      | [total damage] = [Power] / [Armor]
Accuracy | Dodge      | [hit percent] = [Accuracy] / [Dodge]
Critical | Resilience | [crit multiplier] = (1 + [Crit Damage] / [Resilience])

After hit percent is maxed, accuracy adds to crit percent.

## Gear

* Rarity governs total enchantments: [WoW]
  * 1 - white
  * 2 - green
  * 3 - blue
  * 4 - purple
  * 5 - orange, guaranteed uniqueness
* Enchantments
  * common - channels 2 stats.  Doubling up is allowed.
  * rare - channels 3 stats. Tripling up is allowed.
  * unique - provides a special effect:
    * weapon speed
    * initiative
* Channeling the same stat has a diminishing effect
* Items have different focuses - bonus to stat + guaranteed enchantment with stat:
  * Weapon 1 - Power (e.g. saber)
  * Weapon 2 - Accuracy (e.g. rapier)
  * Weapon 3 - Critical (e.g. axe)
  * Shield - dodge
  * Body Armor - armor
  * Helm - resilience
* Disenchant: destroy the item to extract any enchantment.
* Enchant: replace an existing enchantment.  Successive enchants become more expensive.
* Power infuse: increase item level.  Successive power infusions become more expensive.
