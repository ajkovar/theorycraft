## Main Concepts

* Level up forever! No limits.
* Time is the enemy. Mistakes should slow progress, not cost progress.
* Optimize gear loadout to maximize level gain.
* Promote periodical sacrifice / resurrect.
* Online ladder play - reset every day / week
* Different classes.  Comparison should be made only between the same class.
* All stats should be useful. Different classes should prefer different stats.

* Reusable recovery move for 50% health. Causes [5s] of [50%] damage output during battle and [2s] delay after combat.
* Killing blow leaves hero at 1 health and forces recover.
* Resurrecting inherits all gear; increases XP by [1%] per level sacrificed.
* Hero stats start at [100] and increase by [5%] every level.
* Wearing decent (green) gear should increase stats by [100%].
* Enemy stats are balanced to green gear level so assume hero stats == enemy stats.

## Classes

Each class has [3] abilities they can leave active: defense, offense, and low level (for killing weenies).

* Warrior
  * defense - increase armor
  * offense - increase power
  * low level - deal damage to 2 targets
* Rogue
  * defensive - increase dodge
  * offense - increase accuracy
  * low level - initiative (first attack)
* Priest
  * defensive - self heal
  * offense - ??
  * low level - free recover after combat

## Weapons

* Weapons vary by speed.  All speeds should have some benefits.
* All 4 weapon styles should be viable: [PoE]
  * Single Weapon - base
  * Two-Hander - +damage, -attack speed (basically super slow single weapon without option of shield)
  * Sword / Shield - +dodge, [-accuracy]
  * 2x Sword - +attack speed, -accuracy

## Stats

Offense  | Defense    | Equation
-------- | ---------- | --------
Power    | Armor      | [total damage] = [Power] / [Armor]
Accuracy | Dodge      | [hit percent] = [Accuracy] / [Dodge]
Critical | Resilience | [crit multiplier] = (1 + [Crit Damage] / [Resilience])

After hit percent is maxed, accuracy adds to crit percent.

## Gear

* Rarity governs stat quality: [WoW]
  * -10L - gray
  *  -5L - white
  *  +0L - green
  *  +5L - blue
  * +10L - purple
  * +20L - orange
* Gear has specific focuses:
  * Weapon - power
  * Shield - dodge
  * Body Armor - armor
  * Helm - resilience
