## Main Concepts

* Level up forever! No limits.
* Time is the enemy. Mistakes should slow progress, not cost progress.
* Optimize gear loadout to maximize level gain.
* Promote periodical sacrifice / resurrect.
* Online ladder play - reset every day / week
* Different classes.  Comparison should be made only between the same class.
* All stats should be useful. Different classes should prefer different stats.

* Reusable recovery move for 50% health. [Automatic] after battle and costs [1s] during battle.
* Killing blow leaves character at 1 health and forces recover. If player takes another killing blow within 2s, he retreats from combat. [Borderlands]
* Resurrecting inherits all gear; increases XP by [1%] per level sacrificed.
* Character stats start at [100] and increase by [1%] every level.
* Wearing perfect gear should increase stats by [2x].

## Classes

Each class has [3] abilities they can leave active: defense, offense, and low level (for killing weenies).

* Warrior
  * defense - increase armor
  * offense - increase damage
  * low level - deal damage to 2 targets
* Rogue
  * defensive - increase dodge
  * offense - ??
  * low level - initiative (first attack)
* Priest
  * defensive - self heal
  * offense - ??
  * low level - ??

## Weapons

* Weapons vary by speed.  All speeds should have some benefits.
* All 4 weapon styles should be viable: [PoE]
  * Single Weapon - [crit]
  * Sword / Shield - defense
  * 2x Sword - attack speed
  * Two-Hander - damage

## Stats

Offense  | Defense
-------- | -------
Damage   | Armor
Hit      | Dodge
Critical | Resilience

## Gear

* Rarity governs stat quality: [WoW]
  *  -5L - gray
  *  +0L - white
  *  +3L - green
  *  +5L - blue
  *  +7L - purple
  * +10L - orange
* Gear has specific focuses:
  * Weapon - damage
  * Shield - dodge
  * Body Armor - armor
  * Helm - resilience

## Equations

* [total damage] = [Damage] / [Armor]
* [hit percent] = [Hit] / [Dodge] * 70%
* [crit damage] = (1 + [Crit Damage] / [Resilience]) * [total damage]
